Update Engine Release Notes

Release 4
17-November-2008

- Fixed bug in the creation of DMG mount paths. The mount paths are using the
  SHA-1 hash as part of the path component, but SHA-1 hashes often (always?)
  contain forward slashes, which are illegal in path component names. Now,
  forward slashes are replaced with underscores.

- Fixed bug where running Update Engine as root would fail if you did not
  run with sudo and you use bash for your .engine_install script.
