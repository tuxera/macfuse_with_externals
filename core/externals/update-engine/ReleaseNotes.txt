Update Engine Release Notes

Project site:     http://code.google.com/p/update-engine
Discussion group: http://groups.google.com/group/update-engine


Release 7
23-Sep-2009

- Added mechanism for getting product active statistics from the delegate into
  the server class.
- Updated Actions sample UI: now empties the table when starting a new
  download
- Prettied up the project a little.
- Added creationDate as a settable attribute of KSTicket.  If you preserve
  the creationDate, you can see when the user first started using your
  product.
- Added Tag as a settable attribute of KSTicket.  One use of the tag is to
  provide an extra piece of data that gets sent during an update check (assuming
  your server class passes the tag along.)  This is for Chrome's release channel
  support.
- Added "user initiated" parameter to the engine parameters.  This parameter
  is then passed to the install action, and eventually makes its way to
  the KS_USER_INITIATED environment variable for the update scripts.
- Added KS_SUPPORTS_TAG to the update script environment.
- Added KS_INTERACTIVE environment variable so update scripts know that they
  can interact with the user.


Release 6
30-March-2009

- Updated Xcode project to 3.1
- Removed HTTPFetcher logging code to reduce code size
- Added Actions sample


Release 5
5-March-2009

- Added KSDiskImage method to make mount visible in the Finder

- Track migration of GTMHTTPFetcher to GDataHTTPFetcher


Release 4
17-November-2008

- Fixed bug in the creation of DMG mount paths. The mount paths are using the
  SHA-1 hash as part of the path component, but SHA-1 hashes often (always?)
  contain forward slashes, which are illegal in path component names. Now,
  forward slashes are replaced with underscores.

- Fixed bug where running Update Engine as root would fail if you did not
  run with sudo and you use bash for your .engine_install script.

Release 2

- Added EngineRunner selfupdate command.

- Added kshash.sh and enginerunner-plist-generator.sh scripts that can
