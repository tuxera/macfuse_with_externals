procfs will no longer compile as is on Mac OS X 10.4.x. It now requires 10.5.
If you really want to, it should be not too hard to get it to work (minus some
functionality) on the older version of the operating system.

For the /proc/byname/ directory to "work" (and not crash procfs), you must
either run procfs foregrounded (through the -f option), or use the procfs.plist
file to run procfs through launchd.
